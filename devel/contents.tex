\section{Assignment}%
\label{sec:work}

Improve a current product or invent a new one.
The focus should be to use or incorporate research results from the area of 
information security.
\Eg it could be to improve privacy properties for streaming 
services~\cite[\eg][]{anonpass} or
improve usability and security for payment systems.

First look at the current usability and security in the area.
Look for published research that improves the situation.
Suggest improvements and methods to evaluate these.

You should summarize your work in a report.
First summarize how you performed your evaluation, what its results are.
Then summarize your suggestions with motivations why these improve the 
situation.

Based on your report, make a presentation that will be a research-founded 
\enquote{sales pitch} to your security-aware classmates.


\section{Examination}%
\label{sec:exam}

The report must be handed-in in the course platform in PDF or PostScript 
format, no other formats are accepted.
You can find the timeslots for presentations in the course schedule.

The report will be graded according to the following grading criteria:
\begin{description}
  \item[Grade E]
    You have defined a problem to solve.
    You have identified and read some research articles (1--2 per group member) 
    that are \emph{relevant to the problem}.
    You provide an analysis of how these results relate to the problem.

  \item[Grade C]
    You have defined a problem to solve.
    You have read some research articles (\emph{3--4 per group member}) that 
    are relevant to the problem.
    You provide a \emph{deeper} analysis of how these results \emph{can or 
      cannot solve} the problem.

  \item[Grade A]
    You have defined a problem to solve.
    You have read some research articles (3--4 per group member) that are 
    relevant to the problem.
    You provide a deep analysis of how these results can or cannot solve the 
    problem.
    \emph{You sketch your own design and evaluate how well it would solve the 
      problem.}
\end{description}
The grades B and D are intermediary grades.
When assessing the multi-dimensional domain of your work, we will try to make 
as fair a projection as possible onto this linear scale.

The assignment may be done in groups of three to four people.
However, if the proposed project is of proper size you may be excused from this 
limit.
Talk to the tutor and motivate why you need to deviate from the group size.
