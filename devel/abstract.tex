Security is incredibly difficult to add to a solution as an afterthought.
Just as usabiltiy, it must be deeply integrated into any solution.
In this project you must use your knowledge and skills in security and 
usability to design a solution which integrates both security and usability.

In particular, by the end of this project you must be able to
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{evaluate} the usability of security solutions and \emph{suggest} 
    improvements that improve usability and security.
  \item \emph{evaluate} threats, possible protection mechanisms and 
    \emph{design} a high-level approach to protection which considers 
    usability.
  \item \emph{overview} the field of information security, \emph{understand} 
    your own limits and where to search for solutions, e.g.\ experts or 
    published research results that are relevant to the solution of a problem.
  \item \emph{analyse and apply} the results of published research in the 
    security field.
\end{itemize}
