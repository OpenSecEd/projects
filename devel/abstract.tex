Security, privacy and usability have all gained traction in recent years.
High usability has been a must-have since smartphones and tablets entered the 
scene as an alternative to the personal computer.
Privacy was probably best emphasized through the advent of \ac{GDPR} in 2018.
\Ac{GDPR} also implies strong security.
This means that, for any product to succeed, it must have a strong emphasis on 
usability, privacy and security.

This project aims for you to practice and show that you are able
\begin{itemize}
  \item to \emph{evaluate} the usability of security solutions and 
    \emph{suggest} improvements that improve usability and security.
  \item to \emph{evaluate} threats, possible protection mechanisms and to 
    \emph{design} a high-level approach to protection which considers 
    usability.
  \item to \emph{navigate} the field of information security, 
    \emph{distinguish} your own limits and where to search for solutions, \eg 
    experts or published research results that are relevant to the solution of 
    a given problem.
  \item to \emph{analyse and apply} the results of published research in the 
    security field.
\end{itemize}
