For this assignment you should, with corroboration of the tutor, choose one to 
three research papers (depending on their size, they should be around 15 to 20 
pages in total) in information security.

Since the idea is to deepen your knowledge in some areas of information 
security, you must choose papers strongly related to the course.
For example, you can focus on areas such as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item usable security,
  \item privacy enhancing technologies (PETs), or
  \item more advanced methods for guessing passwords.
\end{itemize}
These are just examples, you are free to choose the area and papers in 
corroboration with the tutor.
